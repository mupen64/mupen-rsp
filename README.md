# mupen-rsp

High-performance HLE RSP plugin for Mupen64.

Since this plugin is a critical part of N64 TASing, it has to be given a home somewhere other than floating around as a random dll, along with a maintainer. For any feature or optimization requests, post an issue.

This plugin is originally written by Zilmar along with hacktarux.
